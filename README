This code uses JS and canvas to generate a chart of all the programming languages I've used up to this day.

This is a quick, raw, VERY UGLY code to generate a chart based on data I've previously created with a spreasheet. It
also contains a lot of unused code because of the way I've patched features over time. If I was creating something
more flexible (e.g. something animated), the code would be a lot different... it works well for my static result, but
may not work for everyone.

The end result is here:

Again, the code is kinda flexible, but it may have hidden issues and some hard-coded solutions. It's not a framework.
use at your own risk.
